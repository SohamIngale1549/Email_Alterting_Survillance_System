# Email Alerting Surveillance System

A surveillance system that uses OpenCV for video processing and Python to send email alerts when motion is detected.

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple yet effective surveillance system using OpenCV and Python. It captures video from a webcam or any other camera source, detects motion, and sends an email alert with an attached image of the detected scene.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect motion in real-time video streams.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications with images when motion is detected.
- **Configurable Settings**: Allows users to adjust sensitivity, alert frequency, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV 4.x**
- **smtplib** for sending emails
- Optional: Other libraries like `numpy`, `imutils`, etc., depending on specific requirements.
